    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Suuntain is an iPhone app that helps you navigate in nature and
    find places easily. The app speaks the distance and direction to a
    selected location or route waypoint.</p>
    <p>The app is designed especially for blind and visually impaired
    users, but it’s useful for anyone moving in nature.</p>
    <p><strong>Note! The user is always responsible for their own
    safety. The app is an assistive tool.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="speech-profiles">Speech Profiles</h2>
    <p>Suuntain speaks the distance and direction to a location or
    waypoint according to the speech profile. You can select a speech
    profile in Settings under Speech Profiles. Locations and routes can
    use different profiles. You can also edit existing profiles or
    create new ones.</p>
    <p>Speech profiles are based on distance or time.</p>
    <p>For example, the profile named <strong>Default</strong> is
    distance-based, meaning Suuntain speaks more frequently when you’re
    closer to the location.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When you’re <strong>very close</strong>, within 30 meters,
    speech repeats every 3 seconds.</li>
    <li>When you’re <strong>close</strong>, within 100 meters, speech
    repeats every 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>When you’re at <strong>medium</strong> distance, within 500
    meters, speech repeats every 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>When you’re <strong>far</strong>, over 500 meters away, speech
    repeats every 60 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another example is the profile named <strong>Time 30s</strong>.
    It’s time-based, meaning Suuntain speaks continuously, in this case
    every 30 seconds.</p>
    <p>In distance-based profiles, you can change the meter thresholds
    and speech timing. For example, you can set the <strong>very
    close</strong> threshold to 15 meters and the speech interval to 3
    seconds.</p>
    <h2 id="creating-routes">Creating Routes</h2>
    <p>You can create your own routes using existing locations,
    automatically, or based on locations you select.</p>
    <p>Create a route from saved locations:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Go to the Routes tab.</li>
    <li>Start a route with the “Add new route” button.</li>
    <li>Select waypoints from the list.</li>
    <li>Give the route a name.</li>
    <li>The “Save route” button saves the new route.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Create a new route automatically:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Go to the Routes tab.</li>
    <li>Select “Record new route”.</li>
    <li>Select the “Automatic” tab.</li>
    <li>When you start walking, Suuntain records the entire route
    automatically.</li>
    <li>Select “Add new waypoint” when you want to add the current
    location as a mandatory point on the route.</li>
    <li>Select “Stop recording”.</li>

    <li>Give the route a name.</li>

    <ol type="1">
    <li>Go to the Routes tab.</li>
    <li>Select “Record new route”.</li>
    <li>Select the “Manual” tab.</li>
    <li>Select “Add new waypoint” when you want to add the current
    location to the route.</li>
    <li>Continue walking and add new waypoints at appropriate
    places.</li>
    <li>Select “Stop recording”.</li>
    <li>Give the route a name.</li>
    <li>Select “Save”</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The new route can be found in the Home:Route view.</p>
    <h2 id="gps-breadcrumbs">GPS Breadcrumbs</h2>
    <p>If you recorded a long route but the recording was interrupted
    for some reason, or the phone battery died before saving the route,
    you can recover the route using GPS breadcrumbs:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Launch the Suuntain app.</li>
    <li>Select the “Routes” tab.</li>
    <li>Select “Recover route”. This option is available if a route was
    left incomplete.</li>
    <li>In the “Recover route” map view, give the route a name.</li>
    <li>Select “Save”</li>
    </ol>
